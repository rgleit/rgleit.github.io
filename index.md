**PhD Candidate, Sociology** \
**Stanford University**

I am a PhD candidate in Sociology. I am also a current Graduate Teaching Fellow at the [Stanford Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/people/rebecca-gleit) and a former Institute for Education Sciences (IES) fellow through the [Stanford Center for Education Policy and Analysis](https://cepa.stanford.edu/people/rebecca-gleit). 

I hold a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan and an M.Ed. in Educational Policy and Leadership from Marquette University. Before arriving at Stanford, I taught high school math in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Through both my research and my teaching, I aim to create more equitable spaces for young people. 

My research broadly investigates the question: What institutions do we task with producing meaningful members of society? I use ethnographic methods to examine how institutions shape, respond to, reward, and punish young people. In my current work, I approach this question by examining the intersections of educational and criminal justice institutions, with a specific focus on school-based policing and school discipline practices. 

As an instructor, I aim to build welcoming classrooms for all students, break down hidden curricula, and engage students as critics and creators of knowledge. At Stanford, I have developed and taught courses about statistics, gender, Silicon Valley, teaching pedagogy, and policing. I enjoy designing new, creative activities that actively involve students in the learning process. I also enjoy working with other graduate student instructors to help them promote equitable and effective instructional strategies in their classrooms as a Graduate Teaching Consultant for the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.stanford.edu/ta-training-support/graduate-teaching-consultants/grad-consultant-bios). I am the recipient of the Sociology Department’s Cilker and Centennial Teaching Awards.

My complete teaching portfolio is available [bit.ly/GleitPortfolio](http://bit.ly/GleitPortfolio)

In my free time, I like to experiment in the kitchen, sing along to musical theater soundtracks, and take walks with my dog Elgar.
